Welcome to EvictionWatch! We're excited to help you navigate our app more effectively. Here's a quick guide to get you started: <br/>
<br/>
1. Choose your view: You can view the data at three different levels - neighborhood, census tract, and parcel level.<br/>
<br/>
2. Color-coded map: The colors on the map represent the count of eviction filings, with darker colors indicating higher counts. For example, Richmond has a higher rate of filings compared to University City.<br/>
<br/>
3. Filters: Use the filters to select the year (2016-2023) and month (Jan-Dec) you're interested in.<br/>
<br/>
4. Zoom in: You can also zoom in to view buildings at a block level.<br/>
<br/>
5. Identify at-risk Properties: Click on properties to access detailed information on their landlord, subsidies, violations, and the predicted count of evictions.<br/>
